  _starRatings:
  - Our retirement trip was terrible. We were excited to revisit where we spent our
    younger years, but the activities were far too strenuous for us, and the accommodations
    were uncomfortable. We are very disappointed.
  - We enjoyed revisiting our old stomping grounds, but many of the activities were
    too active for us with our back problems. Some parts were enjoyable, but overall,
    it wasn't the celebratory trip we were looking for.
  - This trip was okay but could've been better. We had some relaxing moments, but
    there were a few things that didn't suit us with our back problems. Overall,
    we were satisfied but would've liked something better.
  - We had a wonderful retirement trip! Going back to the place we cherished in our
    younger years was incredibly special. We'd consider using this agency again!
  - Our was perfect! Revisiting our old favorite place brought back so many memories
    of our travels and when we fell in love. Thank you for taking care of us and
    giving us this unforgettable experience!
