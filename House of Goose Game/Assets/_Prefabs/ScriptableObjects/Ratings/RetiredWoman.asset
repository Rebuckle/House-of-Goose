  _starRatings:
  - Our retirement trip was a disaster. We were excited to revisit where we spent
    our younger years, but the activities were far too strenuous for us, and the
    accommodations were uncomfortable. It was not the relaxing experience we wanted,
    and we left feeling disappointed.
  - We enjoyed revisiting our old stomping grounds, but many of the activities were
    too active for us with our back problems. Some parts were enjoyable, but overall,
    it wasn't the celebratory trip we were looking for.
  - This trip was okay but could've been better. We loved being back in a place filled
    with memories from our youth. We had some relaxing moments, but there were a
    few things that didn't suit us with our back problems. Overall, we were satisfied
    but would've liked something better.
  - We had a wonderful retirement trip! Going back to the place we cherished in our
    younger years was incredibly special. The accommodations were comfortable, and
    we had plenty of time to relax and reminisce. A few minor inconveniences, but
    overall, it was a very enjoyable experience. We'd consider doing it again!
  - Our retirement trip was perfect! Revisiting our old favorite place brought back
    so many wonderful memories of our travels and when we fell in love. I couldn't
    have asked for anything more! We are so happy that we found this agency, thank
    you for taking care of us and giving us this unforgettable experience!
