  _starRatings:
  - 'Our honeymoon was a huge disappointment. The accommodations were awful, and
    nothing felt special or romantic. This was the worst trip of our lives and it
    put a huge strain on our relationship. '
  - The trip was okay, but definitely not what we expected for our honeymoon. Some
    parts were nice, but overall, it lacked the romance and adventures we hoped for.
  - "Our honeymoon was... alright. We had some lovely moments and enjoyed the destination,
    but it wasn\u2019t as special as we wanted. Maybe this agency just isn't built
    for handling honeymoons."
  - We had a great honeymoon! The destination was beautiful, and we had some really
    romantic experiences. A few things could have been better, but overall, we were
    happy. My wife really loved the activities that were booked! Thank you for planning
    this.
  - "Our honeymoon was absolutely perfect! Everything was so special and romantic.
    We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better trip. It was one of our best travel
    experiences and we will definintely come back in the future!"
