  - Unacceptable. The accommodations were shockingly cheap and noisy, completely
    unsuitable for Mr. Fallas and his father. He expected luxury, but instead, they
    got a chaotic mess. You will be hearing from our lawyers.
  - While some aspects showed promise, the trip fell short of Mr. Fallas's standards.
    The accommodations were not as pristine and quiet as expected, with noticeable
    flaws that marred the experience. He is not happy.
  - The trip was somewhat satisfactory, though Mr. Fallas found several flaws that
    detracted from the experience. The luxury was inconsistent, and certain aspects
    did not meet the standards we demand.
  - This was a pleasant trip but not good enough. Most of the accommodations were
    luxurious and quiet, but Mr. Fallas is only satisfied with perfection. It could've
    been better.
  - Mr. Fallas was satisfied with this trip and will be in contact for future plans.
