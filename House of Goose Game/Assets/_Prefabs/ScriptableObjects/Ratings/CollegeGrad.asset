  _starRatings:
  - Our trip was a disaster. The accommodations were awful, our group of friends
    now can't stand each other, and I felt stressed the whole time. Thanks a lot.
  - The trip with my college friends was just okay. The place was decent, but I wasn't
    thrilled with the experience overall.
  - The mystery trip with friends was pretty good! We had fun, though there were
    some unexpected expenses. It was a decent experience. I'd give it a try again.
  - Had a great time with my friends! The place was lovely, and the activities were
    fun. Overall, a positive experience. Would do it again!
  - OMG, the trip was AMAZING! Perfect place, great activities, and so many wonderful
    memories with my friends! Thank you so much for planning all of this. I will
    definitely tell everyone to give this company a shot.
