      question: "No, I haven\u2019t! How does it work?"
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Essentially I will ask you a handful of questions to see what
          you like, dislike, and how you would like to use the budget. You might
          prefer food or lodging rather than transit or activities. Stuff like that.

      question: Oh, that sounds incredible! I love the idea of not knowing where
        we're going until we land. Adds a lot of mystery and suspense to the whole
        adventure. Will we get any hint as to where we are going?
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Besides what you tell me, I will provide a general idea for
          temperature and weather so you can pack appropriately. Do you have any
          more questions or shall we begin?

          want to go to? And do you have a preference on the season?
        nextElement: 8
  - dialogue:
    - line: "Yeah, so there are actually three of us in total! Since we have a limited
        budget, we\u2019re thinking of avoiding peak season so maybe something around
        autumn or winter."

      question: "We\u2019re in Sydney, by the way. So yeah, we want somewhere that
        is lively with a vibrant nightlife, plenty of shopping options, and a generally
        safe place for us to roam around. Does that make sense?"

      question: "We would like a private room to keep our things safe, so if there
        is a bit of wiggle room in the budget, we\u2019re willing to spend a little
        more on that."
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Do you want to plan any dining or transit bundles? Reduce your
