        to a place where I can capture the beauty of nature with my camera."
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Then you are in the right place! Just confirming, you are aware
          that this is a surprise trip agency, right? We build trips based on your
          desires so that you can enjoy a pleasant surprise that you may have never
          even considered before.

      - answerLabel: Perfect, alright. I will begin with a few questions then. What
          sort of place would you like to go to? And do you have a season preference?

      question: Hmmm, I think somewhere with forestry and access to a large beach.
        I would prefer to go during a warm and vibrant season such as the spring
        or summer. I enjoy seeing how nature across the world comes to life after
        the end of a long winter.
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Sounds good. Are you comfortable with being somewhere busy and
          popular? Or would you prefer somewhere more isolated? Spring and summer
          are usually the most popular, so you may have trouble finding quiet spaces
          for your photography.

        the sun rises to get the best shots. Crowds will never be an issue.
      answers:

          or do you have a partner or group coming with you?

        thinking about a week for this trip. It\u2019ll give me enough time to find
        the best places to capture the perfect moment."
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Understood. Would you like me to bundle in any activities to
          help you familiarize yourself with the area and the locals?

      question: "Yes, that is a wonderful suggestion. My favourite travelling moments
        have always revolved around the locals and familiarizing myself with their
        culture. It helps me see the region through a different lens, and they may
        also have suggestions for beautiful hidden gems. Three small activities should
        suffice, I don\u2019t want to overwhelm myself with too much socializing."
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Okay, what should I look for while booking these activities?
          Do you have anything you like? Anything you dislike?

        safe, comfortable, and gives me some privacy. I prefer not to waste money
        on somewhere I will rarely be. I\u2019d rather put my money toward the activities
        you suggest."
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Sure, I will make a note of that. Would you like me to bundle
          in any coverage for dining or transit?

      question: "Hm\u2026 can you tell me more about what those entail?"
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Of course, let me explain. We have a partnership with various
          dining establishments across the globe, so we offer discounted coverage
          for their locations. Either you can opt for a daily meal or possibly reserve
          it on specific dates. As for transit, we can set you up with either a private
          driver, a car rental, or even a public transit pass. Spare you the hassle
          of doing the research on this later. Would you like any of these options?

      question: "Ah, I see. Well, let\u2019s skip the transit coverage. I prefer
        to wander around and get a little lost at times. It\u2019s part of the adventure.
        If need be, I'll ask the locals about their transit. As for the dining, if
        there are any partnerships with restaurants or food stalls run by the residents,
        I\u2019d be interested in booking two meals. One at the start of the trip
        to help me settle in and another at the end to celebrate the journey. I don\u2019t
        mind spending a little more, as long as it supports the local community."
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Fantastic. Alright, I only have two more questions. Where are
          you currently located? And what budget are you working with?

        is R28000. That should be about $2100. Will that be enough for everything?"
      answers:
      - answerLabel: Absolutely, I am sure I can build you a fantastic trip based
          on that. Do you have a preference on what class you're in for the flight?

      answers:
      - answerLabel: I will be selecting a place that fits what you are looking for
          and will provide you with tickets for our partner airline. We have a reserved
          section for surprise travellers so they will not discover their destination
          until they land. You will receive the dates, the flight duration, and a
          review of the weather so that you may pack appropriately. All of your information
          will become available for viewing the moment you land. Does that sound
          good?
