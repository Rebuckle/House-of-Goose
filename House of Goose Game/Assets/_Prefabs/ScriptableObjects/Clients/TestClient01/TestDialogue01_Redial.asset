      client: 0
    - line: Yes it is. Who is this?
      client: 1
    - line: It's *inputPlayerName* from *inputAgencyName*. I just need to confirm
        a few things about the trip.
      client: 0
    - line: Sure, not a problem. What can I do for you?
      client: 1
    - line: I'm going to go over a few details before I proceed. I'll get right into
        it. When do you want to go and what sort of location would you like?
      client: 0
    - line: I'm looking for somewhere with nature and a large waterfront. And I'd
        prefer to go during the spring or summer.
      client: 1
    - line: Of course. And what were the plans for lodging, transit, and dining?
      client: 0
    - line: Just two meals somewhere owned and operated entirely locally. Lodging,
        somewhere cheap but private. And I don't need any transit coverage.
      client: 1
    - line: Perfect, I will write that down. What am I planning for activities?
      client: 0
    - line: I believe we said three in total. Nothing luxurious, just something to
        help me meet the locals and explore the area.
      client: 1

      client: 1

      client: 0
    - line: $2100.
      client: 1
    - line: Great! That covers everything. I'll let you know when I have wrapped
