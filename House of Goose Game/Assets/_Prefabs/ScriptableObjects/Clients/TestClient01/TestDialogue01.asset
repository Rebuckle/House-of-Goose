    - line: Hi, this is *inputPlayerName* from *inputAgencyName*. How can I help
        you?
      client: 0
    - line: "Ah, yes, hello, it\u2019s nice to meet you. I want to plan a trip to
        a place where I can capture the beauty of nature with my camera."
      client: 1
    - line: Then you are in the right place! Just confirming, you are aware that
        this is a surprise trip agency, right? We build trips based on your desires
        so that you can enjoy a pleasant surprise that you may have never even considered
        before.
      client: 0
    - line: "Yes I\u2019ve used similar services before and have always been pleased
        with the results."
      client: 1
    - line: Perfect, alright. I will begin with a few questions then. What sort of
        place would you like to go to? And do you have a season preference?
      client: 0
    - line: Hmmm, I think somewhere with forestry and access to a large beach. I
        would prefer to go during a warm and vibrant season such as the spring or
        summer. I enjoy seeing how nature across the world comes to life after the
        end of a long winter.
      client: 1
    - line: Sounds good. Are you comfortable with being somewhere busy and popular?
        Or would you prefer somewhere more isolated? Spring and summer are usually
        the most popular, so you may have trouble finding quiet spaces for your photography.
      client: 0
    - line: I can assure you that it will not be an issue. I always wake up before
        the sun rises to get the best shots. Crowds will never be an issue.
      client: 1
    - line: Great! How long are you thinking? And are you the only traveller or do
        you have a partner or group coming with you?
      client: 0
    - line: "I don\u2019t like distractions, so I will be travelling alone. I\u2019m
        thinking about a week for this trip. It\u2019ll give me enough time to find
        the best places to capture the perfect moment."
      client: 1
    - line: Understood. Would you like me to bundle in any activities to help you
        familiarize yourself with the area and the locals?
      client: 0
    - line: "Yes, that is a wonderful suggestion. My favourite travelling moments
        have always revolved around the locals and familiarizing myself with their
        culture. It helps me see the region through a different lens, and they may
        also have suggestions for beautiful hidden gems. Three small activities should
        suffice, I don\u2019t want to overwhelm myself with too much socializing."
      client: 1
    - line: Okay, what should I look for while booking these activities? Do you have
        anything you like? Anything you dislike?
      client: 0
    - line: "I want something that will immerse me in the environment and community.
        Whether that is through food, small adventures, or common thrills, I want
        the authentic experience. As for dislikes, I absolutely detest anything luxurious
        and overly extravagant. I also tend to avoid crowded spaces. It\u2019s crucial
        for me to capture the essence of the place and not get lost in artificial
        comforts or get a headache in the process."
      client: 1
    - line: Totally understandable. I have a few places in mind already. Do you have
        a preference for lodging accommodations?
      client: 0
    - line: "I\u2019m not particularly picky. I just want somewhere that\u2019s safe,
        comfortable, and gives me some privacy. I prefer not to waste money on somewhere
        I will rarely be. I\u2019d rather put my money toward the activities you
        suggest."
      client: 1
    - line: Sure, I will make a note of that. Would you like me to bundle in any
        coverage for dining or transit?
      client: 0
    - line: "Hm\u2026 can you tell me more about what those entail?"
      client: 1
    - line: Of course, let me explain. We have a partnership with various dining
        establishments across the globe, so we offer discounted coverage for their
        locations. Either you can opt for a daily meal or possibly reserve it on
        specific dates. As for transit, we can set you up with either a private driver,
        a car rental, or even a public transit pass. Spare you the hassle of doing
        the research on this later. Would you like any of these options?
      client: 0
    - line: "Ah, I see. Well, let\u2019s skip the transit coverage. I prefer to wander
        around and get a little lost at times. It\u2019s part of the adventure. If
        need be, I'll ask the locals about their transit. As for the dining, if there
        are any partnerships with restaurants or food stalls run by the residents,
        I\u2019d be interested in booking two meals. One at the start of the trip
        to help me settle in and another at the end to celebrate the journey. I don\u2019t
        mind spending a little more, as long as it supports the local community."
      client: 1
    - line: Fantastic. Alright, I only have two more questions. Where are you currently
        located? And what budget are you working with?
      client: 0
    - line: "I\u2019m currently located just outside Cape Town, and my budget is
        R28000. That should be about $2100. Will that be enough for everything?"
      client: 1
    - line: Absolutely, I am sure I can build you a fantastic trip based on that.
        Do you have a preference on what class you're in for the flight?
      client: 0
    - line: I'm comfortable with economy. But could you select an aisle seat? My
        legs are a bit long.
      client: 1
    - line: Sure, no problem. That's everything from my end. Do you have any questions?
      client: 0
    - line: What are the next steps for booking this trip?
      client: 1
    - line: I will be selecting a place that fits what you are looking for and will
        provide you with tickets for our partner airline. We have a reserved section
        for surprise travellers so they will not discover their destination until
        they land. You will receive the dates, the flight duration, and a review
        of the weather so that you may pack appropriately. All of your information
        will become available for viewing the moment you land. Does that sound good?
      client: 0
    - line: "Yes, that sounds perfect to me. Thank you so much for your time and
        assistance, you\u2019ve been most helpful."
      client: 1
    - line: My pleasure. I will be in contact if I have any additional questions.
        I will also notify you when the trip has been booked.
      client: 0
    - line: I look forward to hearing from you. Until then, take care and thank you
        for all your help.
      client: 1
    - line: Of course! And thank you for choosing *inputAgencyName*. Have a good
        one. Bye for now.
      client: 0
    - line: Bye.
